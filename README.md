# AU_predictor
AU[1,2,4,6,12,15,20,25]

1/ Due to the limition of file_size,the pre-calculated landmarks,which should have been in the path of './test/landmarks/' ,are not up-loaded,same as the image-boder and segmented face.
Thus ,we give a cloud disk url https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ekvRFk0S-gTPaMyN5gGSvg,in which them stored.Please decompress and place them into the Corresponding path in this project by the name.

2/ All of the preprocessing about the image-boder and segmented face also have been implemented in the data-seg-store.py

3/ With all the pre-calculated data already,AU_Test.py could be used for prediction
