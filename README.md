1/
Due to the limition of file_size,we give a cloud disk url https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rOgVD-5Lzz5gRqQt0f0t0g ,in which the segmented face,border image and the landmarks stored.Please decompress and place them into the Corresponding path in this project by the name,while the cropped_and_aligned frames and the original videos from the original dataset without any change are not supplied. 

2/
All of the preprocessing about the image-boder and segmented face also have been implemented in the data-seg-store.py

3/
With all the pre-calculated data already,AU_Test.py could be used for prediction and the model could be re-trained with Aspect_based_train.py
